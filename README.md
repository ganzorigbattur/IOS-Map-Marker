# Map-Marker
Make notes on a map
It is the Xcode project and the files that I wrote are in /MapAndNoteTry folder.
In the map if user press for longer than 2 seconds, it will create a note that has title of the locations address.
If address is not avialable, it will create note titled as current time of the phone.
